					Archery began as a tool for survival then warfare and sport combined, but this changed 
					as firearms became the main ranged weapon used in war, causing archery to become fully 
					an activity only used for fun. This shift finished many centuries ago in the year 1583,
					where in Finsbury, England, many believed the first large scale archery competition,
					for fun, happened.

					With gunpowder based weapons, the bow and arrow became obsolete as a primary weapon of 
					war and this led to a big change. Archery changed from a military necessity  to a fun
					activity, with Archery clubs and societies beginning to form in England, which held
					annual tournaments. The first large scale competition being in 1583 in Finsbury, England.
					In the 19th century it changed again to become a more formalized sport and the first
					Grand National Archery Society meeting was held in York in 1844, and the "York Round"
					(many shots at different distances) became a standardized format.

					<p>Archery's transformation from a weapon of war and necessity into a recognized sport began in Europe, primarily in Great Britain, after its military relevance faded with the introduction of gunpowder in the 16th and 17th centuries. Instead of completely abandoning the bow, the upper classes maintained the skill as a social and recreational pastime during the 1700s. Early competitions were more like fashionable festivals than formal sporting events, with archers gathering at grand properties to shoot at specific targets for prizes and social honor. These gatherings led to the formation of the first organized archery clubs and societies, such as the Ancient Scorton Arrow in 1673 and the Royal Company of Archers in 1704. These societies were crucial because they preserved the necessary techniques and equipment, but their rules were local and lacked consistency, meaning a competition in one town might be completely different from one in another.   
<br>
<br>
The true move toward standardized sport began in the 1800s. As the popularity of these social shoots grew, the need for uniform, national rules became clear. This standardization was achieved in 1844 with the first Grand National Archery Meeting in York, England. At this event, organizers formalized the York Round, a set of rules that defined the shooting distances, the size of the target face, and the scoring system. This set of rules became the blueprint for modern competitive archery, transforming it into a proper sport with universal benchmarks. This new structure quickly spread, and by the end of the century, archery had earned enough global status to be included in the first modern Olympic Games in Paris in 1900, cementing its transition from a military art and simple social hobby to an internationally recognized athletic discipline.   
<br>
<br>
In North America, archery's development as a sport was slightly different, often combining the social revival with the rise of ethical bowhunting. While social clubs mimicked the European tradition, the passion for using the bow to hunt, championed by figures like Saxton Pope and Arthur Young, became a powerful driver. This focus promoted the practice of traditional or "primitive" archery for skill and sport outside of formal target ranges, leading to the creation of field archery—shooting at targets placed at varying, often unknown, distances in natural settings. Whether on the aristocratic lawn or in the American woods, the early establishment of standardized rules and dedicated associations during this era was the necessary foundation that would later allow the sport to embrace modern technology and grow into the high-tech, global competition seen today.</p>

					Archery was part of the very first modern Olympic Games in 1900. It also appeared in the
					1904, 1908, and 1920 Games. However, after 1920, the sport was removed from the Olympics.
					The reason was a lack of standardized rules; each country used its own scoring and
					equipment rules. This made the competition unfair and difficult to manage on a global
					scale, leading to a long absence from the Olympics.

					Archery returned to the Olympic Games after a long absence, thanks to the
					creation of the "Fédération Internationale de Tir à l'Arc" (FITA) in 1931, now known as
					"World Archery". This global governing body was formed with one main goal: to create a
					single set of standardized rules for all international competitions. By unifying the
					scoring, equipment, and competition formats, FITA made the sport fair and consistent
					for all nations. This hard work paid off, and archery was permanently reintroduced into
					the Olympic program at the 1972 Munich Games, starting its modern era as a major
					international sport.

					Since archery's return to the Olympics in 1972, the sport has entered a new age of
					technological advancement and global competition. Recurve bows, the only bow type allowed
					in the Olympics, have been refined with modern materials like carbon fiber and aluminum,
					making them more consistent and durable. Additionally, the modern sport has seen the rise
					of the compound bow, which, with its system of pulleys and cables, has made archery more
					accessible and accurate for recreational shooters and hunters, as well as in other
					competitive formats like 3D and field archery.

					Through its long and dynamic history, archery has evolved from a vital skill for hunting

					Today, archery continues to connect ancient traditions of focus and discipline with
