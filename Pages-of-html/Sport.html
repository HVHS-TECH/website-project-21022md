					Archery began as a tool for survival then warfare and sport combined, but this changed 
					as firearms became the main ranged weapon used in war, causing archery to become fully 
					an activity only used for fun. This shift finished many centuries ago in the year 1583,
					where in Finsbury, England, many believed the first large scale archery competition,
					for fun, happened.

				<p>
					With gunpowder based weapons, the bow and arrow became obsolete as a primary weapon of 
					war and this led to a big change. Archery changed from a military necessity  to a fun
					activity, with Archery clubs and societies beginning to form in England, which held
					annual tournaments. The first large scale competition being in 1583 in Finsbury, England.
					In the 19th century it changed again to become a more formalized sport and the first
					Grand National Archery Society meeting was held in York in 1844, and the "York Round"
					(many shots at different distances) became a standardized format.

					Archery was part of the very first modern Olympic Games in 1900. It also appeared in the
					1904, 1908, and 1920 Games. However, after 1920, the sport was removed from the Olympics.
					The reason was a lack of standardized rules; each country used its own scoring and
					equipment rules. This made the competition unfair and difficult to manage on a global
					scale, leading to a long absence from the Olympics.

					Archery returned to the Olympic Games after a long absence, thanks to the
					creation of the "Fédération Internationale de Tir à l'Arc" (FITA) in 1931, now known as
					"World Archery". This global governing body was formed with one main goal: to create a
					single set of standardized rules for all international competitions. By unifying the
					scoring, equipment, and competition formats, FITA made the sport fair and consistent
					for all nations. This hard work paid off, and archery was permanently reintroduced into
					the Olympic program at the 1972 Munich Games, starting its modern era as a major
					international sport.

					Since archery's return to the Olympics in 1972, the sport has entered a new age of
					technological advancement and global competition. Recurve bows, the only bow type allowed
					in the Olympics, have been refined with modern materials like carbon fiber and aluminum,
					making them more consistent and durable. Additionally, the modern sport has seen the rise
					of the compound bow, which, with its system of pulleys and cables, has made archery more
					accessible and accurate for recreational shooters and hunters, as well as in other
					competitive formats like 3D and field archery.

					Through its long and dynamic history, archery has evolved from a vital skill for hunting
					and war into a globally recognized sport. After facing challenges with a lack of
					standardized rules, the sport earned its permanent place in the Olympics in 1972.
					Today, archery continues to connect ancient traditions of focus and discipline with
					the advancements of modern technology, creating a sport that is both timeless and 
					innovative.
